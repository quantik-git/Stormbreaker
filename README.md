# What can I do with this&#191;
This framework allows for agile development when paired with the atom editor. A panoply of classes is included from basic layout templates to specific individual components.\
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.
