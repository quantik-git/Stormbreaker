# What can I do with this&#191;
This framework allows for agile development when paired with the atom editor. A panoply of classes is included from basic layout templates to specific individual components.
## Such as:
* Articles
* Forms
* Cards
* Navbars
* Grid-system

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

---
# Getting Started:
To get started you can either download the whole project from this repository.\
Or you can use the github repo CDN and download the **variables.js** file to alter the variables.
### CSS only:
```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/quantik-git/Stormbreaker@latest/Stormbreaker.css">
```
### JS and jQuery:
```HTML
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/quantik-git/Stormbreaker@latest/functionality.js"></script>
```
### variables.js:
```HTML
<script src="variables.js" async></script>
```
Paste this before of the CSS CDN link to prevent visual bugs.\
**Don't forget to include the `async` attribute to minimize loading time**
